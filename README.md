In this project, you've implemented an employee management system using Django as the backend framework and Django Rest Framework (DRF) for building a RESTful API. The application allows users to create, read, update, and delete employee records. Each employee can have associated address details, work experiences, qualifications, and projects, with the ability to upload images for projects. The frontend utilizes Bootstrap for styling and jQuery for AJAX requests to handle dynamic form submissions and updates.
